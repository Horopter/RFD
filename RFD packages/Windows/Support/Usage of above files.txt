RFD - Support : Designed for Visual Studio 2010

First thing to do would be to place all the files in their correct directories.
glut.h: ‘C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\include\GL\’
glut32.lib: ‘C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\lib\’
glut32.dll: ‘C:\Windows\System32\’
For 64-bit machines, you will want to do this.
glut32.dll: ‘C:\Windows\SysWOW64\’

Happy gaming!!!
